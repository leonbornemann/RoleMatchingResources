## Code
* Main Implementation in scala. Implements EM,CBRB (with and without decay),CQM,TSM,VSM as well as various data exports and transformations to exchange data between the different programming languages: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SDKJSDFPAWOIIEUFZHLSXMCBVKUERHF/README.md
* Evaluation and Plots via Jupyter Notebooks: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/UAHGFIADFGOSKHIQAEFUHKSADHVBOQWIFJ/README.md
* Implementation (in go) of RM: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LSHEnsembleForRoleMatching-CFEC/README.md
